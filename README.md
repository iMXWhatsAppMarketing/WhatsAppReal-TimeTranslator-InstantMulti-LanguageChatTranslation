A free, easy-to-use extension that removes language barriers in your WhatsApp chats!

The WhatsApp Real-Time – a free, easy-to-use extension that removes language barriers in your WhatsApp chats!
With this plugin on WhatsApp Web, all incoming and outgoing messages are auto-translated—whatever the source language—so you and your contacts always see chats in your preferred languages.

Supports 100+ languages—from English and Spanish to Arabic, Vietnamese, and dozens of major and minor languages worldwide. Deeply optimized on Google Translate’s engine, it handles everything from legal jargon to casual chat with precision—far more reliable than standard translators.

Instant Auto-Translation—Super Simple

Incoming Auto-Translate: Automatically detects and translates incoming messages in real time, displaying original and translated text side by side.
Outgoing Auto-Translate: Type in any language and the recipient receives the translated text instantly.  Built-in “failed translation interceptor” prevents untranslated text from being sent if a translation error occurs.
Always Free—Works Even Better with iMX-WS Cloud
The extension is 100% free! When paired with iMX-WS Cloud, manage multiple accounts, auto-reply with translation, review chat history easily—perfect for seamless cross-border business.
